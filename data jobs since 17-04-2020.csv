Product Designer,https://www.domestika.org/es/jobs/83096-product-designer-madrid-espana,TaxDown,Tiempo completo,"Madrid, España",29/01/21,"About us 
Launched in 2019, TaxDown wants to be the leading platform for consumers and companies to manage their taxes and finances.
TaxDown was born with the aim of creating a technological platform that allows taxpayers to process their taxes from any device, maximizing their savings and making the process as agile and simple as possible. In less than two years we already have more than 60k taxers who trust us, and we thank them for working continuously to keep helping them.
We help people save money 
TaxDown is the only solution in Spain that allows you to file your taxes digitally, in less than 15 minutes, with less than 9 questions, and with an average saving of €385 per user.
We want to recover every euro that is yours by right. This year we have managed to save more than €3.8M for Spanish families. During our first 2 income tax seasons, we have revolutionized the way people do their taxes because we want to help everyone to better understand their tax obligations and rights, not just those who can afford a tax advisor.
The challenge? What if we manage to continue helping people and saving them money? What if all those people who are scared to death due to ignorance, who due to lack of resources cannot pay an advisor, or who innocently believe that the Tax Agency does a rigorous job with the tax return draft (¨Borrador¨), could have an affordable, simple solution that solves an obvious problem such as personal income tax filing? Well, they will probably feel very grateful, and that is what we like the most, helping and being useful.
There are more than 24 million people who file tax returns in Spain, and we want TaxDown to be the alternative they choose when the tax season arrives.
What we are looking 🦄
We are looking for a good person, who can become a world-class PD, optimistic, passionate, creative, dynamic, and analytical. Someone to lead our product efforts and seize the opportunity to build magical experiences for our taxers, in a market yet to be exploited, helping us to define and to execute our strategy and vision. Attracted to start-ups, technology and wanting to change the status quo. Willing to accept responsibilities above the average, a high degree of autonomy. This is a highly visible and impactful role that will own the product strategy and roadmap to acquire the next 1 million taxers on TaxDown.
Through trial and error, we have learned that people do not apply unless we provide a guideline. But what is more important to us than a number are the experiences you have had, and the skills you’ve developed, regardless of the length of time it took you to get where you are. Have 10+ years? Awesome, please apply. Have only 3 years, but feel you meet the requirements below? Great, please apply.

• Work together across all disciplines of design, product management, engineering, data science, leadership, marketing, and planning

User is king! Continuously work on understanding our taxers' needs

About GELT
Gelt is a Madrid-based company that allows FMCG brands to run promotions to bring traffic to the physical point of sale, so that they buy their product.
How do we do it? Very easy, we have tried to reinvent coupons by returning the money to users for buying the products they like. The majority of users (80% to be exact) use our app inside the Supermarket, when they are in front of the shelf, and decide to buy the product that appears in the app because it has an incentive. The user buys the product (in any Supermarket), pays the price and by taking a photo of the purchase receipt, we take care of validating with the brand that it is a valid ticket and that the product was actually bought and we give the incentive that They can be 40 cents or 2 euros, whatever the brand decides. When the user reaches the accumulated € 20, we send him a code and he can go to an ATM to get his hard cash. That easy!
If you want to be in our team, we recommend that you start by getting to know our app. You can download it here: http://onelink.to/5dkhgp

Acerca de IOMED
IOMED es una empresa tecnológica de nueva creación puntera en el campo de la extracción y el procesamiento masivo de datos médicos. Lo compone un equipo pequeño, unido, joven, dinámico y flexible, que, tras varios años de trabajo en conjunto, se caracteriza por su agilidad, disfrute del trabajo y compenetración. 
Acorde, buscamos candidatos con ganas de innovar, lanzar un proyecto relevante y crecer con él, siempre disfrutando cada día del trabajo en equipo y de los retos, que son muchos. Nuestro ""dream team"" está formado por estadísticos, bioinformáticos, gente del mundo de los negocios y la medicina. 
En IOMED los modelos que desarrolles analizarán cientos de millones de textos hospitalarios, ayudando a extraer variables que acelerarán la investigación clínica. 
Como empleador, ofrecemos igualdad de oportunidades. Todavía somos un equipo pequeño y estamos comprometidos a crecer de manera inclusiva. Queremos aumentar nuestro equipo con personas talentosas y dinámicas, independientemente de su raza, color, religión, nacionalidad, sexo, discapacidad física o edad. 
Lo que hacemos 
Hoy en día, alrededor del 50% de los ensayos clínicos se retrasan debido al reclutamiento de pacientes, ya que la recopilación de datos de pacientes se realiza de forma manual. Como resultado, la investigación clínica es altamente ineficiente tanto en tiempo como en costo, por lo que lleva años y miles de millones de dólares desarrollar un nuevo medicamento. 
Este problema podría resolverse a través de datos del mundo real, es decir, aquellos contenidos en las historias clínicas electrónicas (HCE). Pero desafortunadamente, hasta el 85% de los datos clínicos existentes no están estructurados, es decir, en texto plano. 
IOMED ha encontrado la solución a esta situación, haciendo posible aprovechar al máximo el valor de los datos clínicos del mundo real. Desarrollamos una herramienta que extrae los datos necesarios de los textos clínicos, lo que da como resultado una base de datos estructurada, estandarizada e interoperable que contiene la información clínica completa de los hospitales. 
De este modo, la información no reutilizable se transforma en datos disponibles para la Investigación clínica, lo que permite incrementar la cantidad de pacientes que cumplen con los criterios, así como reducir el tiempo total y el trabajo manual dedicado a esta tarea. "

Acerca de IOMED: 
IOMED es una empresa tecnológica de nueva creación puntera en el campo de la extracción y el procesamiento masivo de datos médicos. Lo compone un equipo pequeño, unido, joven, dinámico y flexible, que, tras varios años de trabajo en conjunto, se caracteriza por su agilidad, disfrute del trabajo y compenetración. 
Acorde, buscamos candidatos con ganas de innovar, lanzar un proyecto relevante y crecer con él, siempre disfrutando cada día del trabajo en equipo y de los retos, que son muchos. Nuestro ""dream team"" está formado por estadísticos, bioinformáticos, gente del mundo de los negocios y la medicina. 
En IOMED los modelos que desarrolles analizarán cientos de millones de textos hospitalarios, ayudando a extraer variables que acelerarán la investigación clínica. 
Como empleador, ofrecemos igualdad de oportunidades. Todavía somos un equipo pequeño y estamos comprometidos a crecer de manera inclusiva. Queremos aumentar nuestro equipo con personas talentosas y dinámicas, independientemente de su raza, color, religión, nacionalidad, sexo, discapacidad física o edad. 
Lo que hacemos:
Hoy en día, alrededor del 50% de los ensayos clínicos se retrasan debido al reclutamiento de pacientes, ya que la recopilación de datos de pacientes se realiza de forma manual. Como resultado, la investigación clínica es altamente ineficiente tanto en tiempo como en costo, por lo que lleva años y miles de millones de dólares desarrollar un nuevo medicamento. 
Este problema podría resolverse a través de datos del mundo real, es decir, aquellos contenidos en las historias clínicas electrónicas (HCE). Pero desafortunadamente, hasta el 85% de los datos clínicos existentes no están estructurados, es decir, en texto plano. 
IOMED ha encontrado la solución a esta situación, haciendo posible aprovechar al máximo el valor de los datos clínicos del mundo real. Desarrollamos una herramienta que extrae los datos necesarios de los textos clínicos, lo que da como resultado una base de datos estructurada, estandarizada e interoperable que contiene la información clínica completa de los hospitales. 
De este modo, la información no reutilizable se transforma en datos disponibles para la Investigación clínica, lo que permite incrementar la cantidad de pacientes que cumplen con los criterios, así como reducir el tiempo total y el trabajo manual dedicado a esta tarea.

Game Artist,https://www.domestika.org/es/jobs/80492-game-artist-en-remoto,Bravo Company,Tiempo completo,En remoto,09/09/20,"Here’s an opportunity for an experienced game artist to join a team of seasoned games makers and their recently funded start-up. 
We have raised capital from the “who is who” of early stage gaming investors. 
Our first game blends a casual/puzzle experience with a light metagame (think merging-puzzle meets Homescapes meta) and has been initially validated by upper percentile early retention and engagement metrics.
We now offer an opportunity for a 2D Game Artist/Illustrator to help us create the visuals of this brand new game. Among your responsibilities:
• Create amazing and consistent 2D characters, backgrounds and props from the first concept to the final asset ready for implementation.
• Build the world of the game keeping technical and artistic requirements in mind.
• Understand and empathize with the audience to create art they love.
• Work collaboratively with all members of the team.
Our company offers a choice between fully remote engagement in the “CET +/- 1hour”  time zones as well as employment at their new Berlin base.
About you:
This would be the right role for you if you... 
• want to make games that bring perpetual entertainment to players around the world.
• are a humble team player with strong curiosity in others’ views.
• have ~ 4 years of relevant experience in the videogames industry.
• gathered strong demonstrable artistic knowledge (line, shape, composition, light, color, rendering…).
• have a deep understanding of design, including architectural elements and props.
• gained experience creating isometric worlds and are familiar with tiling processes.
• enjoy learning new tools. Basics of Unity would be an additional super power.

More about us:
We create mobile games that are incredibly fun and can be enjoyed by players for a very very long time. We approach development as “data driven artists” who believe that an idea is only good if it works for the players. That’s why we develop in rapid iterative phases, being both passionate and data driven.

We have previously worked for renowned companies (Wooga, King, Wargaming, Good Games and Peak among others). We have shipped and worked on games that have generated hundreds of millions of euros, including a top 50 grossing game that our co-founder led from inception to release. We also have a couple of failures under our belt which qualify us even further for success. 
Our games blend casual and midcore gameplay mechanics and will be supported with strong social layers, aiming to define a whole new category of perpetual games.

We have secured investment from some of the most iconic games entrepreneurs including Victor Kislyi, Founder & CEO Wargaming and Sami Lababidi, serial entrepreneur, co-founder & CTO Playfish, and others as well the leading early stage institutional investors Creandum (Spotify, Klarna, iZettle, Small Giant Games) and Initial Capital (Supercell, Space Ape Games).
We have a solid runway with sufficient capital to pay required contractors, test user acquisition, etc.  Things are going well, our first game delivers convincing metrics and we are pushing hard but carefully towards a full release.
What else:

You will join a small interdisciplinary team of seven very experienced game professionals covering all aspects of art, engineering, data analysis as well as company leadership.
This is a permanent full-time contract. We offer competitive salaries, confirming that they can accommodate exceptional candidates, and as an early stage employee you could benefit from the equity package that would get allocated after passing a trial period.

We also provide visa sponsorship and full relocation assistance if required.
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for everyone who works here or with us, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion (or lack thereof) and game preferences. "

We welcome candidates of all different backgrounds to apply. Each new team member is an opportunity for us to bring in different perspectives, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Biings is committed to building a supportive place for you to do rewarding and meaningful work.
About the job
The Web & Mobile team is composed of three people, whose work has lately given rise to our mobile app and a brand new front-end to the desktop version of Biings. You’ll join the team and work closely with them.
The team works in Barcelona (Aticco MED), everyone has a dedicated desk, so will you. All team members speak either French, English or both.
Essentially, the W&M team is responsible for implementing, documenting and maintaining the Web and the Mobile version of Biings. The team works mostly on the front-end parts and uses our back-end API to retrieve and persist data.
We believe the back-end and front-end of any new feature should always be built simultaneously. The job is to join the W&M team and work on the back-end in close collaboration with the front-end programmers.
About you
We’re looking for someone with a good back-end PHP experience (1-2 years or more). Front-end programming experience, especially with Vue.js, is a plus but not a requirement. Here are some aspects of the job you should be comfortable with:
Back-end PHP applications
Laravel or similar frameworks
Object-oriented programming
Entity-relationship databases, and SQL queries
Code versioning and git branching
Being involved in the end-to-end lifecycle of features, from concept to deployment.
You won’t know all the frameworks and methods we use on day one, and we don’t expect you to. Solid fundamentals in software development and teamwork will be the most helpful.
This job is in-house in Barcelona. While you can work remotely on occasions, you should be comfortable working the majority of time together with the team, in the coworking space.
While we all speak English, our company is mostly composed of french-speaking people. English or French should be one of the strongest languages you speak. We very happily welcome of course people with any language background.
On top of open-mindedness and curiosity, we value people who can take a stand yet commit even if they disagree. We subject ideas to a lot of considerations and challenge each other often, yet we all know that we are here to do good work and create the best possible version of our software solution.
Who we are
Biings was founded in 2013 and is part of a group of three companies, all experts in collective performance and improving health at work. Today we’re a company of about 7 people spread across 3 cities with our headquarters in Morges, Switzerland.
We’re HR-engineers, designers, developers, learners, travelers, hikers, soccer players, moviegoers, climbers, snowboarders, kite surfers, dancers, knitters, yoga teachers, musicians, parents, and hard workers.
We make Biings (the product), we write code, support our clients and help them keep their company sustainable, people wise!
What we offer
Biings is an Equal Opportunity Employer and pays according to industry standards. The salary for this position is between €30,000 and €35,000 depending on your experience. We assess seniority during the interviewing process.
Benefits at Biings are all about helping you feel comfortable at work as well as outside of work. Work rate goes from 80% to 100%, with flexible working hours. Every year Biings offers 4 weeks of paid vacation and the standard national holidays. Your vacation time is prorated your first year at Biings.
Our office in Barcelona offers the classics of a comfy workplace, along with a few extra Yoga, Hiit and meditation classes.
